# Big-O Time Complexity – First 7 Algorithms
Algorithm 1 – O(n)

A single loop runs from 1 to n. Number of operations = n. Big-O = O(n).

Algorithm 2 – O(m+n)

Nested loops each run n times. Total operations = n * n. Big-O = O(n²).

Algorithm 3 – O(n^2*log n)

Loop variable doubles each time (i = i * 2). Number of iterations = log₂ n. Big-O = O(log n).

Algorithm 4 – O(log n)

Loop variable divides by a constant (i = i / 5). Number of iterations = log₅ n. Big-O = O(log n).

Algorithm 5 – O(n*log n)

Loop runs until i < n³ and multiplies by 5. Iterations = log₅(n³) = 3 log n. Big-O = O(log n).

Algorithm 6 – O(logn)

Loop condition is i² ≤ n. Iterations ≈ √n. Big-O = O(√n).

Algorithm 7 – O(n^2)

k increases as 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + i. Loop stops when k ≈ n. i ≈ √n. Big-O = O(√n).
